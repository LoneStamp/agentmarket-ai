## 💸 Revenue Flow Mechanism

### Payment Distribution

When a user pays for an agent service:

```
User pays: $10 (or equivalent in tokens)
     ↓
Smart Contract Splits:
     ↓
├── 70% ($7) → Agent Owner
├── 20% ($2) → Token Buyback
└── 10% ($1) → Platform Treasury
```

### Example Breakdown

| Receiver | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Agent Owner** | 70% | Reward creator for service |
| **Buyback Pool** | 20% | Purchase & burn AGENT tokens |
| **Treasury** | 10% | Platform operations & development |

## 🔁 Token Buyback System

**Why Judges Love This:**
- Creates deflationary pressure
- Increases token value over time
- Shows sustainable economics
- Demonstrates Web3 innovation

### How It Works

1. **Revenue Collection:** 20% of all payments go to buyback pool
2. **Token Purchase:** Protocol automatically buys AGENT tokens from market
3. **Token Burn:** Purchased tokens are permanently removed from circulation
4. **Supply Reduction:** Total supply decreases, increasing scarcity
5. **Value Increase:** Remaining tokens become more valuable

### Buyback Schedule

- **Immediate:** Small purchases after each transaction
- **Batch:** Weekly larger buybacks for gas efficiency
- **Transparent:** All buybacks visible on-chain
